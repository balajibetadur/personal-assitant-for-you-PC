# personal assitant for you PC
This is one of my favorite project done so far. I use many modules from python to create a auto assistant which will do al the works that is said by the user.


# voice assitant SPOTTY
It is a voice assistant like alexa and google assistant.It recognizes your voice when you speak and performs the function.It also replies you by speaking.I created a speak function where if you pass a string as a parameter then it will speak the string for you.

Once you run the program it will ask for the identification passward i,e authentication .You can change the passward to anything you want.
